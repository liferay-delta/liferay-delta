### Hi there

If you want to send changes in some of our components, please send it to the liferay-delta/liferay-delta repository to be reviewed.

The more information you provide about the pull request, the better it will be for us to review and forward it as soon as possible. So taking some time adding information about the changes you made in the PR or linking the associated JIRA ticket is advised.

The members of the team that manage the repo, are: @marcoscv-work, @AlfredSoto and @jkappler
